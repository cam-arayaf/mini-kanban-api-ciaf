## Notes

1. Go to '/functions' folder.
2. Open package.json.
3. Edit "engines": { "node": "10" } to "engines": { "node": "13.7.0" }. This is because Firebase Functions only supports version 8 and 10 of Node.js for deployment.
4. Save changes.
5. Open terminal in '/functions' folder.
6. Execute 'yarn' command to install node_modules.
